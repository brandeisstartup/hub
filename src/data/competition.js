      "The Heller Startup Challenge is a weekend long startup incubator where students form teams to develop and pitch their idea for a social impact venture. Over the course of three days students will take their idea from concept phase to implementation through coaching and mentorship from expert mentors and volunteers. Teams will have the opportunity to pitch their final idea to a panel of esteemed judges to compete for prize money and the opportunity to participate in higher-profile challenges. At the core of the Heller Startup Challenge is a mission to advance social justice through these innovative social ventures.",

    description: `The Pitch Summit takes place from Friday evening to Saturday evening. In this time you will  be given and trained in the essential tools required for pitching and presenting any idea. Our workshop professionals will conduct sessions on “Leading with Presence”, “Storytelling”, “Communication Skills”, and “Voice Exercise”. 
The focus of this event is on developing and deepening the all-important skills for pitching. We are not looking for you to develop a startup pitch. There are other opportunities for that (check out the links above). 
The startup ideas and materials for you to build your pitch around will be given out on Friday evening. The materials underlying your pitches come from some of the successful Hacks that were developed in late January, at the DEISHacks hackathon.
You will also get to meet other entrepreneurially minded students, enjoy free food and snacks, present for the $1,000 first prize, and have fun while you learn essential skills not just for pitching a business, but also for presenting yourself and your ideas.
