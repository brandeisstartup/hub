    about: `Even the greatest business idea requires a compelling pitch to stand out. The Pitch Summit shows you how it is done. This workshop and prize competition will give you all the tools you need to creatively and persuasively craft your idea into a compelling, five-minute story and present it to an audience.

      Your challenge will be to come up with a creative solution to a business sustainability opportunity. The final presentations will be done in five-person teams. Teammates for the pitch will be assigned on Saturday.
      
      By the end of the Pitch Summit, you will feel comfortable and confident standing at the front of the room presenting your team’s idea — a skill that will come in handy no matter what you decide to do in the future.
      
      Food, fun and beverages are all included. The winning team will receive a $1,000 award. What are you waiting for?
      
      This event is sponsored by the Asper Center for Global Entrepreneurship at Brandeis International Business School."`,
